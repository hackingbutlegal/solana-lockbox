## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-12 (v2 Devnet Release)

### üöÄ Deployed
- **v2 Program ID**: `7JxsHjdReydiz36jwsWuvwwR28qqK6V454VwFJnnSkoB`
- **Network**: Solana Devnet
- **Slot**: 414207771
- **Transaction**: 9yTWHq4kbJAhEuaqvbUedgnsU9vjBzyE83zbWKFL735T5V9rN8K4HeZ4U7qCuaPdoXRukxdSQem3aWkYua7PQpt
- **Size**: 355,672 bytes (347 KB)

### üêõ Critical Fixes
1. **Instruction Discriminators** - Fixed incorrect values causing InstructionFallbackNotFound (0x65)
   - All discriminators were placeholder values instead of SHA256 hashes
   - Created `scripts/generate-discriminators.js` to calculate correct values
   - Updated `client-v2.ts` with correct discriminators for all 9 instructions
   - See: [TECHNICAL_FIXES_OCT_2025.md](./TECHNICAL_FIXES_OCT_2025.md#issue-1)

2. **INIT_SPACE Calculation** - Fixed missing 4 bytes causing AccountDidNotDeserialize (0xbbb)
   - Missing length prefix for `encrypted_index` Vec in master_lockbox.rs
   - Account deserialization failed immediately after creation
   - Fixed: Changed INIT_SPACE from 102 to 106 bytes
   - See: [TECHNICAL_FIXES_OCT_2025.md](./TECHNICAL_FIXES_OCT_2025.md#issue-2)

3. **UI Error Handling** - Fixed missing "Initialize Lockbox" button
   - Context treated "account not found" as error instead of expected state
   - Updated LockboxV2Context.tsx to clear error for uninitialized accounts
   - See: [TECHNICAL_FIXES_OCT_2025.md](./TECHNICAL_FIXES_OCT_2025.md#issue-3)

4. **Lazy Session Initialization** - Eliminated double signature prompts
   - Users were prompted to sign twice: once on connect, once on transaction
   - Session key only needed for encryption/decryption, not viewing vault
   - Deferred session initialization until first CRUD operation
   - Users now sign only once when performing password operations
   - See: [DEPLOYMENT_V2.md](./DEPLOYMENT_V2.md#issue-4-double-signature-prompts-lazy-session-initialization)

## Deployment Information

### Devnet
- **Program ID**: `5nr7xe1U3k6U6zPEmW3FCbPyXCa7jr7JpudaLKuVNyvZ`
- **Network**: Solana Devnet
- **Explorer**: [View on Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/address/5nr7xe1U3k6U6zPEmW3FCbPyXCa7jr7JpudaLKuVNyvZ?cluster=devnet)

## Migration Guides

### Upgrading to 1.2.0

If you were using direct program interactions, you can now use the SDK:

**Before:**
```typescript
const tx = await program.methods
  .storeEncrypted(ciphertext, nonce, salt)
  .accounts({ ... })
  .rpc();
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { LockboxClient } from '@lockbox/sdk';

const client = new LockboxClient({ connection, wallet });
await client.store('My secret data');
```

The SDK handles all encryption, key derivation, and account management automatically.
