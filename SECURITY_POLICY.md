- Enable session timeouts
- Regularly review stored credentials
- Back up your wallet seed phrase securely

‚úÖ **Devnet Testing**
- **DO NOT** store production credentials on devnet
- Use test accounts only
- Understand devnet is for testing, not production use

### For Developers

‚úÖ **Integration Security**
- Review our SDK documentation thoroughly
- Validate all inputs before encryption
- Handle errors gracefully
- Keep dependencies updated

‚úÖ **Audit Your Integration**
- Test with devnet extensively
- Review cryptographic implementations
- Follow our security guidelines
- Report issues you discover
