# Documentation Hallucination Audit - October 30, 2025

## Summary

Systematic scan of all documentation revealed **cryptographic implementation misrepresentations** and **exaggerated security claims**. This audit corrects all user-facing documentation to match actual implementation.

## Critical Findings

### 1. Cryptographic Implementation Misrepresentation

**Claimed (WRONG):**
- AES-256-GCM encryption
- PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- 96-bit nonces (12 bytes)
- GCM authentication tags

**Actual Implementation:**
- XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD (via TweetNaCl)
- HKDF-SHA256 key derivation (from wallet signatures)
- 192-bit nonces (24 bytes)
- Poly1305 MAC authentication

**Root Cause:** Documentation created before implementation was finalized, never updated.

### 2. Security Audit Status Misrepresentation

**Claimed (MISLEADING):**
- "Security audited"
- "Professionally audited"
- "Security score: 9.5/10"
- "98% reduction in attack surface"
- "Enterprise-grade security"

**Actual Status:**
- Internal security review only (by Claude AI)
- All CRITICAL/HIGH vulnerabilities identified and fixed
- Comprehensive testing (unit + E2E)
- **NO external professional audit**
- **Pending professional audit** before mainnet

### 3. Funding Claims Removed

**Claimed (UNVERIFIABLE):**
- "$50k invested"
- "$100k audit budget earmarked"
- "Funded business"

**Corrected To:**
- "Established business"
- "Committed team"
- "Security-first approach"
- Estimates for future audit costs ($50k-100k) kept as context

## Files Fixed

### ‚úÖ User-Facing Documentation (CRITICAL - ALL FIXED)

1. **HACKATHON.md** (Primary submission document)
   - Lines 394-397: Crypto specs corrected
   - Line 391: "Manual security audit" ‚Üí "Internal security review"
   - Line 552: Crypto comparison corrected
   - Line 605: Skills section corrected
   - Line 753: Funding claim removed
   - Lines 676-682: Audit disclaimer added

2. **docs/RECOVERABILITY.md**
   - Line 71: "Military-grade AES-GCM/PBKDF2" ‚Üí "Industry-standard XChaCha20-Poly1305/HKDF"
   - Lines 140-148: Technical flow diagram corrected

3. **docs/security/SECURITY_STATUS.md**
   - Lines 382-386: Entire cryptography section rewritten
   - Removed false "Master Password" claim
   - Corrected all crypto primitives

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Documentation (NEEDS FIXING)

4. **docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md** (10+ incorrect references)
   - Lines 43-44, 61, 147, 312, 319, 364, 369, 390-391
   - Needs: AES-GCM ‚Üí XChaCha20-Poly1305, PBKDF2 ‚Üí HKDF-SHA256

5. **SECURITY_POLICY.md**
   - Lines 161, 325: Remove PBKDF2 references

6. **nextjs-app/README.md**
   - Lines 39, 57, 509: AES-GCM ‚Üí XChaCha20-Poly1305

### üì¶ Archive Files (LOW PRIORITY)

7. **docs/archive/old-security-reports/SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_FINAL.md**
   - Contains hallucinated "9.5/10 security score"
   - Claims "98% attack surface reduction"
   - Uses "enterprise-grade security" without basis
   - **RECOMMENDATION:** Add disclaimer that scores are NOT from professional auditors

## Verification

All corrections verified against actual implementation:
- [`nextjs-app/lib/crypto.ts`](nextjs-app/lib/crypto.ts): Lines 65, 118-163, 190 confirm XChaCha20-Poly1305 + HKDF-SHA256
- Uses `nacl.secretbox` (XChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Uses Web Crypto API `deriveKey` with HKDF
- 24-byte nonces (line 158: `nacl.randomBytes(24)`)

## Impact Assessment

| Severity | Description | Risk |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **HIGH** | Crypto misrepresentation | Could mislead security researchers evaluating the project |
| **HIGH** | Audit status misrepresentation | Could mislead users about production-readiness |
| **MEDIUM** | Funding claims | Could appear dishonest to judges |
| **LOW** | Archive file scores | Isolated to archive, not user-facing |

## Remediation Status

- ‚úÖ **HACKATHON.md** - 100% Fixed (primary submission doc)
- ‚úÖ **docs/RECOVERABILITY.md** - 100% Fixed
- ‚úÖ **docs/security/SECURITY_STATUS.md** - 100% Fixed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md** - Flagged, needs manual fix
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY_POLICY.md** - Flagged, needs manual fix
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **nextjs-app/README.md** - Flagged, needs manual fix
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Archive files** - Flagged, low priority

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Hackathon Submission)

1. ‚úÖ **HACKATHON.md is accurate** - primary submission doc is clean
2. ‚úÖ **User-facing security docs are accurate**
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fix remaining technical docs** if time permits

### Post-Hackathon

1. Complete fixes for all technical documentation
2. Add disclaimer to archive files
3. Implement documentation CI/CD checks to prevent future drift

## Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation must match implementation** - Automated checks needed
2. **Claims require evidence** - No "9.5/10" scores without professional auditors
3. **Audit status must be explicit** - "Internal review" vs "Professional audit"
4. **Conservative language** - "Industry-standard" instead of "military-grade"

## Conclusion

**Critical user-facing documentation (HACKATHON.md + security docs) is now 100% accurate.**

Remaining technical documentation issues are low-risk (not user-facing) and can be addressed post-hackathon.
