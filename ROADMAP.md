## üìù Notes

### Deprioritized Features
These features don't align with core value proposition or are premature:
- ~~Custom branding~~ - <1% user benefit
- ~~SSO Integration (SAML, OAuth)~~ - Conflicts with Web3-first approach
- ~~Desktop Apps (Electron)~~ - PWA sufficient
- ~~Compliance Reporting (SOC 2, ISO 27001)~~ - Premature for pre-mainnet

### Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Solana (devnet ‚Üí mainnet)
- **Smart Contract**: Anchor Framework 0.30.1+
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript
- **Encryption**: XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD, HKDF
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Testing**: Anchor tests, Jest, Playwright

### Development Philosophy
1. **Security First**: Every feature reviewed for security implications
2. **User Experience**: Web2 UX with Web3 security
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Ship working features frequently
4. **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes post-mainnet
5. **Documentation**: Every feature fully documented
6. **Testing**: 80%+ code coverage minimum
