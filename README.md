## What's New in v2.0?

Solana Lockbox v2.0 expands the original 1KB encrypted storage into a comprehensive password manager with blockchain-native innovations:

### üöÄ Blockchain-Native Innovations
- **Social Recovery**: Never lose your passwords - trusted guardians can help recover access via Shamir Secret Sharing (M-of-N threshold cryptography)
- **Emergency Access**: Dead man's switch for digital estate planning - designated contacts gain access after inactivity period
- **Gasless Transactions**: Subscription pools cover transaction fees - Web2 UX with Web3 security

### üéØ Core Features
- **Unlimited Storage**: Scale from 1KB to 1MB+ via dynamic chunk allocation
- **Password Management**: Store, organize, and retrieve unlimited password entries
- **Categories & Folders**: Organize credentials with hierarchical structure
- **Encrypted Search**: Search without decrypting using blind indexes (coming Q1 2026)
- **Secure Sharing**: Share passwords with other users via asymmetric encryption (coming Q2 2026)
- **TOTP/2FA**: Built-in 2FA code generation (coming Q3 2026)
- **Password Health**: Analyze weak, reused, and old passwords (coming Q2 2026)

### üíé Subscription Tiers
- **Free**: 1KB (~10 passwords)
- **Basic**: 10KB (~100 passwords) - 0.001 SOL/month
- **Premium**: 100KB (~1,000 passwords) - 0.01 SOL/month
- **Enterprise**: 1MB+ (unlimited) - 0.1 SOL/month

### üîê Security
- Zero-knowledge encryption (client-side only)
- Wallet-derived encryption keys
- XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD
- HKDF key derivation
- No persistent secrets

### üé® User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Lazy Signature Prompts**: Single wallet signature on first password operation
- **Sticky Navigation**: Persistent header for easy access
- **Touch-Optimized**: Mobile-friendly interface with proper touch targets
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional design with Next.js 15 + Turbopack

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Tier Storage System
```
Master Lockbox Account
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Storage Chunk 1 (10KB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Storage Chunk 2 (10KB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Storage Chunk 3 (10KB)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Storage Chunk N...
```

### Key Components
1. **Master Lockbox**: Manages metadata, subscriptions, and chunk references
2. **Storage Chunks**: Hold encrypted password entries (expandable via realloc)
3. **Search Index**: Blind indexes for encrypted search
4. **Shared Vaults**: Secure password sharing between users

### Refactored Architecture (October 2025)

The codebase has undergone a comprehensive refactor to improve maintainability, type safety, and user experience:

**SDK Improvements**:
- V2 as default export, V1 namespaced as legacy
- Discriminated union types for type-safe password entries
- Centralized constants (no magic values)
- Retry utility with exponential backoff for network failures
- User-friendly error formatting with actionable suggestions
- WeakMap-based session storage for enhanced security

**Frontend Organization**:
- Components organized by purpose: `modals/`, `ui/`, `features/`, `layout/`
- Context architecture split into 4 focused providers:
  - `AuthContext`: Session management & client creation
  - `LockboxContext`: Master lockbox metadata
  - `PasswordContext`: Password CRUD operations
  - `SubscriptionContext`: Subscription tier management
- Error boundaries at multiple layers for graceful failure handling
- Enhanced toast system with loading states, actions, and progress bars
- Consistent loading states across all async operations
- Barrel exports for clean imports

**Developer Experience**:
- Type-safe password entry types (LoginEntry, CreditCardEntry, etc.)
- Zod validation matching TypeScript types
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Better error messages with suggested fixes
- Automatic retry for transient failures

### Phase 4: Search & Intelligence (Q1 2026) üîç NEXT - 6-8 weeks - HIGH priority
- [ ] Blind index search system with HMAC-based keyword hashing
- [ ] Fuzzy search on client side with trigram matching
- [ ] Advanced filtering and sorting
- [ ] Favorites and recently accessed entries
- [ ] Import/export functionality (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass formats)
- [ ] Batch operations (import/update/delete multiple entries)

**Why**: Essential for usability at scale. Users need to find passwords quickly.

---

### Phase 5: Social Recovery & Emergency Access (Q1 2026) üî• CRITICAL - 8-10 weeks
- [ ] **Social Recovery via Threshold Cryptography** (Shamir Secret Sharing)
  - M-of-N guardian network for wallet recovery
  - On-chain encrypted share distribution
  - Guardian invitation and acceptance flow
  - Recovery initiation with mandatory delay
  - Guardian approval threshold enforcement
- [ ] **Time-Locked Emergency Access** (Dead Man's Switch)
  - Inactivity monitoring with on-chain countdown
  - Emergency contact notification system
  - Mandatory waiting period before access
  - Owner cancellation mechanism
  - Partial or full vault access grants

**Why**: Solves Web3's biggest problem - wallet loss = permanent data loss. THIS is our killer feature.

---

### Phase 6: Gasless Transactions & UX (Q2 2026) - 4-6 weeks - MEDIUM priority
- [ ] **Gasless Transaction Pool** (Subscription-Funded)
  - Subscription SOL pools for transaction fees
  - Transaction delegation system
  - Fee-less password operations for paid users
  - Usage quotas per tier
  - Pool refill automation
- [ ] Password generator with strength scoring
- [ ] Password health dashboard (weak, reused, old passwords)
- [ ] Password strength analyzer with suggestions

**Why**: Makes Web3 feel like Web2. Users shouldn't think about gas.

---

### Phase 7: Sharing & Collaboration (Q2 2026) - 6-8 weeks - MEDIUM priority
- [ ] Secure sharing protocol with asymmetric encryption (X25519)
- [ ] Per-entry permission management (view, edit, share)
- [ ] Share expiration and revocation
- [ ] Audit log infrastructure for all operations

**Why**: Teams need to share credentials securely. Builds foundation for enterprise features.

---

### Phase 8: Advanced Security (Q3 2026) - 4-6 weeks - MEDIUM priority
- [ ] 2FA/TOTP code generation and storage
- [ ] Password history tracking (last 10 versions)
- [ ] Password expiration and rotation reminders
- [ ] Breach monitoring integration (HaveIBeenPwned API)
- [ ] Biometric authentication support (WebAuthn)

**Why**: Security features that differentiate us from basic password managers.

---

### Phase 9: Platform Expansion (Q3-Q4 2026) - 8-10 weeks - LOW priority
- [ ] Mobile applications (iOS, Android with React Native)
- [ ] CLI tool for advanced users
- [ ] Cross-platform synchronization
- [ ] API access for third-party integrations

**Why**: Expand reach after core product is solid.

---

### Future Innovations (Post-Mainnet)

**Browser Extension**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge with auto-fill
**Cross-Chain Portability**: Export encrypted vault to Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum
**AI-Powered Security**: ML-based phishing detection, smart password suggestions
**NFT-Gated Passwords**: Credentials that require NFT ownership to decrypt
**Hardware Wallet Integration**: Ledger/Trezor as second factor

---

### Deprioritized Features

These features have been removed from the roadmap as they don't align with our core value proposition or are premature for pre-mainnet:

- ~~Custom branding~~ - Adds complexity for <1% of users
- ~~SSO Integration (SAML, OAuth)~~ - Conflicts with Web3-first philosophy
- ~~Desktop Apps (Electron)~~ - PWA covers 90% of use cases
- ~~Compliance Reporting (SOC 2, ISO 27001)~~ - Premature for pre-mainnet product
