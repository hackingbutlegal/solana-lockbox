## Known Issues & Resolutions

### Issue #1: Playwright Configuration Conflict
**Problem:** Playwright attempting to run Jest test files (`.test.ts`)
**Error:** `ReferenceError: describe is not defined` in non-Playwright test files
**Resolution:** ✅ FIXED - Added `testMatch: '**/*.spec.ts'` to `playwright.config.ts`
**Status:** Resolved in commit 56f3f00

### Issue #2: Type Import Errors
**Problem:** PasswordEntryType enum vs string literal mismatch
**Error:** `Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'PasswordEntryType'`
**Resolution:** ✅ FIXED - Updated test-data.ts to use enum values instead of string literals
**Status:** Resolved in commit 6802d98

### Issue #3: Dev Server Port Conflict
**Problem:** Port 3000 already in use
**Note:** Playwright config uses port 3001 automatically
**Resolution:** No action needed - working as designed
**Status:** Not an issue

---

## Test Execution Blockers & Mitigations

### Current Status: READY FOR EXECUTION ✅

The test suite is fully configured and ready to run. However, optimal execution requires:

#### Prerequisites Met:
- ✅ Playwright installed (`npx playwright install chromium`)
- ✅ Test files created and committed
- ✅ Configuration fixed (testMatch pattern)
- ✅ Helper modules implemented
- ✅ Dev server auto-start configured

#### Optional (for Real Phantom Testing):
- ⚠️ Phantom wallet extension (for integration tests with real wallet)
- ⚠️ Test wallet with devnet SOL (for blockchain transactions)
- ⚠️ Wallet password: `hello123` (configurable)

**Note:** All tests can run without Phantom using `mockWalletConnection()` helper!

Location: batch-operations.spec.ts:185
Expected: Offline message shown
Actual: [Error details if test fails]
Remediation: Check network error handling in components
```

### Scenario 2: Validation Failures
**Tested By:** `password-crud.spec.ts` - Validation tests
**Test Cases:**
- Required field validation
- Input length limits
- Special character handling
- XSS prevention

**Expected Behavior:**
- Inline validation errors
- Prevention of malicious input
- Clear user guidance

**Error Format:**
```
Test: prevents XSS in password fields
Location: password-crud.spec.ts:178
Expected: XSS payload sanitized
Actual: [Alert triggered / Script executed]
Remediation: Review input sanitization in input-sanitization-v2.ts
```

### Scenario 3: State Management Issues
**Tested By:** `wallet-authentication.spec.ts` - Session tests
**Test Cases:**
- Session persistence across refreshes
- State cleanup on disconnect
- Concurrent operation handling

**Expected Behavior:**
- Consistent state across navigation
- Clean disconnect
- No memory leaks

## Developer Remediation Guide

### When a Test Fails

1. **Check the test report:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:report
   ```
   - View screenshots of failures
   - Watch video replay
   - Review console logs

2. **Run test in UI mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:ui
   ```
   - Time-travel debugging
   - Step through test
   - Inspect DOM state

3. **Debug specific test:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --debug -g "test name here"
   ```

4. **Common failure patterns:**

   **Pattern: Selector not found**
   ```
   Error: locator.click: Target closed
   ```
   **Fix:** Update selector in test, add `data-testid` to component

   **Pattern: Timeout**
   ```
   Error: Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded
   ```
   **Fix:** Increase timeout or optimize slow operation

   **Pattern: Assertion failed**
   ```
   Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
   Expected: true
   Received: false
   ```
   **Fix:** Review app logic, may indicate actual bug
