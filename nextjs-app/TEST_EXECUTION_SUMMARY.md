## üöÄ How to Execute Tests

### Option 1: Run All Tests (Recommended First Time)

```bash
cd /Users/graffito/solana-lockbox/nextjs-app

# Interactive UI mode - BEST for first run
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

**What happens:**
- Opens Playwright Test UI
- Shows all 290+ tests
- Click any test to run
- Watch execution in real-time
- Time-travel debugging available

### Option 2: Run Smoke Tests First

```bash
# Quick validation (6 tests, ~15 seconds)
npx playwright test smoke.spec.ts --headed
```

**What this tests:**
- Homepage loads ‚úì
- Dashboard accessible ‚úì
- Settings page works ‚úì
- No console errors ‚úì
- Responsive design ‚úì

### Option 3: Run Full Suite Headless

```bash
# All tests in background (8-12 minutes)
npm run test:e2e
```

**When to use:**
- CI/CD pipeline
- Nightly regression tests
- Before deployment

### Option 4: Run Specific Feature Area

```bash
# Test wallet functionality only
npx playwright test wallet-authentication.spec.ts

# Test password CRUD only
npx playwright test password-crud.spec.ts

# Test batch operations
npx playwright test batch-operations.spec.ts
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Resolutions

### Issue #1: Configuration Conflict ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Error:**
```
Error: Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here.
Most common reasons include:
- You have two different versions of @playwright/test
```

**Root Cause:**
Playwright was attempting to load Jest test files (`.test.ts`) in addition to Playwright specs (`.spec.ts`).

**Resolution:** ‚úÖ FIXED
```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './e2e',
  testMatch: '**/*.spec.ts',  // ‚Üê Added this line
  // ...
});
```

**Commit:** `56f3f00`
**Status:** Resolved and pushed

---

### Issue #2: Type Import Errors ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Error:**
```
Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'PasswordEntryType'
```

**Root Cause:**
PasswordEntryType is an enum with numeric values, not string literals.

**Resolution:** ‚úÖ FIXED
```typescript
// Before
const PASSWORD_TYPES = ['Login', 'CreditCard', ...];

// After
const PASSWORD_TYPES = [
  PasswordEntryType.Login,
  PasswordEntryType.CreditCard,
  ...
];
```

**Files Updated:**
- `e2e/password-crud.spec.ts`
- `e2e/helpers/test-data.ts`

**Commit:** `6802d98`
**Status:** Resolved and pushed

---

### Issue #3: Dev Server Port ‚ÑπÔ∏è INFORMATIONAL

**Observation:**
```
‚ö† Port 3000 is in use, using port 3001 instead
```

**Analysis:**
This is expected behavior. Playwright config uses port 3001.

**Action Required:** None
**Status:** Working as designed

---

## üîç Test Execution Results Format

### Expected Success Output

When tests pass, you'll see:

```
Running 6 tests using 1 worker

  ‚úì smoke.spec.ts:11:3 ‚Ä∫ homepage loads successfully (2.3s)
  ‚úì smoke.spec.ts:16:3 ‚Ä∫ dashboard displays without wallet (1.8s)
  ‚úì smoke.spec.ts:23:3 ‚Ä∫ settings page loads correctly (2.1s)
  ‚úì smoke.spec.ts:30:3 ‚Ä∫ no console errors on page load (1.5s)
  ‚úì smoke.spec.ts:42:3 ‚Ä∫ application is responsive - mobile (2.4s)
  ‚úì smoke.spec.ts:52:3 ‚Ä∫ application is responsive - tablet (2.2s)

  6 passed (12.3s)
```

### Actionable Error Format

When tests fail, you get:

```
  ‚úó password-crud.spec.ts:45:3 ‚Ä∫ can create password entry for Login (5.2s)

Error: locator.fill: Target closed
=================================

Test File: password-crud.spec.ts
Line Number: 45
Test Name: can create password entry for Login
Duration: 5.2s
Status: FAILED

Error Details:
--------------
  43 |   const titleInput = page.locator('input[name="title"]').first();
  44 |   if (await titleInput.isVisible({ timeout: 2000 })) {
> 45 |     await titleInput.fill(testEntry.title);
     |     ^
  46 |   }

Failure Reason: Element was closed/removed before interaction

Screenshot: test-results/password-crud-can-create-.../test-failed-1.png
Video: test-results/password-crud-can-create-.../video.webm

Remediation Steps for Senior Developer:
----------------------------------------
1. Check if modal/dialog is closing prematurely
2. Review PasswordEntryModal.tsx for race conditions
3. Add waitForTimeout before fill operation
4. Verify element selector: input[name="title"]
5. Check for competing click handlers

Suggested Fix:
--------------
await page.waitForSelector('input[name="title"]', { state: 'attached' });
await titleInput.fill(testEntry.title);

Related Files:
--------------
- components/modals/PasswordEntryModal.tsx (UI component)
- e2e/password-crud.spec.ts:45 (test assertion)
- e2e/helpers/test-data.ts (test data)

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Failed Tests

### Step 1: View Test Report

```bash
npm run test:report
```

Opens HTML report with:
- Test execution timeline
- Screenshots of failures
- Video recordings
- Console logs
- Network activity

### Step 2: Run in Debug Mode

```bash
# Debug specific failing test
npx playwright test --debug -g "can create password entry"
```

**Features:**
- Pause before each action
- Step through test line-by-line
- Inspect DOM state
- Try selectors in console
- Modify and re-run

### Step 3: Run in Headed Mode

```bash
# Watch test run in real browser
npx playwright test password-crud.spec.ts --headed
```

**What you see:**
- Browser window opens
- Actions happen visually
- Can pause and inspect
- Verify UI behavior

### Step 4: Check Dev Server Logs

```bash
# In separate terminal
npm run dev
```

Look for:
- React errors
- API failures
- Console warnings
- Network errors

## üìã Common Error Patterns & Fixes

### Pattern 1: Selector Not Found

**Error:**
```
Error: locator.click: Selector "button:has-text('Save')" not found
```

**Cause:** Element doesn't exist or text changed

**Fix:**
1. Add `data-testid` to component:
   ```tsx
   <button data-testid="save-button">Save</button>
   ```

2. Update test selector:
   ```typescript
   await page.locator('[data-testid="save-button"]').click();
   ```

---

### Pattern 2: Timeout Exceeded

**Error:**
```
Error: Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded
```

**Cause:** Operation taking too long

**Fix:**
1. Increase timeout for specific test:
   ```typescript
   test('slow operation', async ({ page }) => {
     test.setTimeout(60000); // 60 seconds
     // ... test code
   });
   ```

2. Or optimize the slow operation in app code

---

### Pattern 3: Flaky Test

**Symptom:** Test passes sometimes, fails others

**Common Causes:**
- Network timing
- Animation delays
- Race conditions

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Bad: Hard-coded wait
await page.waitForTimeout(1000);

// Good: Wait for specific state
await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="loaded"]', { state: 'visible' });
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
```

---

### Pattern 4: Mock Wallet Not Working

**Error:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'connect' of undefined
```

**Cause:** Mock wallet not injected

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Ensure this is called BEFORE wallet operations
await mockWalletConnection(page);
await page.waitForTimeout(500); // Let injection complete

// Then proceed with test
await page.locator('button:has-text("Connect")').click();
```

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Execution Times

| Scope | Test Count | Duration | Use Case |
|-------|------------|----------|----------|
| Single test | 1 | 1-3s | Quick validation |
| Smoke tests | 6 | 15-30s | Pre-commit check |
| Feature area | 20-50 | 60-180s | Feature development |
| Full suite | 290+ | 480-720s | Nightly regression |

### Performance Optimization

**Current:** 290 tests in ~11 minutes
**Optimized:** Could reduce to ~8 minutes with:
- Increased parallelization (workers: 4)
- Test sharding across machines
- Selective test execution (only changed features)

---

## üéØ Critical Test Scenarios

### Must-Pass Tests (Blockers for Deployment)

1. **Smoke Tests** (smoke.spec.ts) - ALL MUST PASS
   - Homepage loads
   - No console errors
   - Basic navigation works

2. **Wallet Authentication** (wallet-authentication.spec.ts)
   - Connection flow works
   - Session persists
   - Disconnect cleans up

3. **Password CRUD - Login Type** (password-crud.spec.ts)
   - Create Login entry
   - Read/view entry
   - Update entry
   - Delete entry

### High-Priority Tests (Should Pass)

4. **Search** (search-filter-favorites.spec.ts)
   - Search by title works
   - Results update in real-time

5. **Import/Export** (danger-zone-advanced.spec.ts)
   - Export passwords to JSON
   - Import validates format

### Nice-to-Have Tests (Can Investigate Later)

6. **Advanced Features**
   - 2FA auto-refresh
   - Password rotation scheduling
   - Emergency recovery timeout
