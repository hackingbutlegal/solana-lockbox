## Implementation Details

### 1. On-Chain State Structures

#### Social Recovery (`state/recovery.rs`)

**RecoveryConfig Account**:
- Stores guardian network and threshold settings
- M-of-N configuration (e.g., 3-of-5)
- Recovery delay enforcement (1-30 days)
- PDA: `["recovery_config", owner_pubkey]`
- Max 10 guardians per user

```rust
pub struct RecoveryConfig {
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub threshold: u8,                    // M
    pub total_guardians: u8,              // N
    pub guardians: Vec<Guardian>,         // Max 10
    pub recovery_delay: i64,              // 1-30 days
    pub created_at: i64,
    pub last_modified: i64,
    pub bump: u8,
}
```

**Guardian Structure**:
- Encrypted share storage (X25519 encryption)
- Share index for Shamir reconstruction
- Status tracking (Pending, Active, Revoked)
- Optional encrypted nickname

```rust
pub struct Guardian {
    pub guardian_pubkey: Pubkey,
    pub share_index: u8,
    pub encrypted_share: Vec<u8>,      // Max 128 bytes
    pub added_at: i64,
    pub nickname_encrypted: Vec<u8>,   // Max 64 bytes
    pub status: GuardianStatus,
}
```

**RecoveryRequest Account**:
- Active recovery attempt tracking
- Time-lock protection
- Guardian approval collection
- PDA: `["recovery_request", owner_pubkey, request_id]`

```rust
pub struct RecoveryRequest {
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub requester: Pubkey,
    pub request_id: u64,
    pub requested_at: i64,
    pub ready_at: i64,                 // requested_at + delay
    pub approvals: Vec<RecoveryApproval>,
    pub new_owner: Option<Pubkey>,
    pub status: RecoveryStatus,
    pub bump: u8,
}
```

#### Emergency Access (`state/emergency_access.rs`)

**EmergencyAccess Account**:
- Inactivity monitoring
- Two-stage countdown system
- Emergency contact management
- PDA: `["emergency_access", owner_pubkey]`

```rust
pub struct EmergencyAccess {
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub emergency_contacts: Vec<EmergencyContact>,  // Max 5
    pub inactivity_period: i64,                     // 30 days - 1 year
    pub grace_period: i64,                          // Default 7 days
    pub last_activity: i64,
    pub countdown_started: Option<i64>,
    pub status: EmergencyStatus,
    pub created_at: i64,
    pub bump: u8,
}
```

**EmergencyContact Structure**:
- Access level configuration
- Encrypted emergency key
- Status tracking

```rust
pub struct EmergencyContact {
    pub contact_pubkey: Pubkey,
    pub contact_name_encrypted: Vec<u8>,    // Max 64 bytes
    pub access_level: EmergencyAccessLevel,  // ViewOnly, FullAccess, TransferOwnership
    pub encrypted_key: Vec<u8>,              // Max 128 bytes
    pub added_at: i64,
    pub access_granted_at: Option<i64>,
    pub status: EmergencyContactStatus,
}
```

### 2. Smart Contract Instructions

#### Social Recovery Instructions (`instructions/recovery_management.rs`)

**Setup Phase**:
1. `initialize_recovery_config` - Create recovery config (Premium/Enterprise only)
2. `add_guardian` - Add guardian with encrypted share
3. `accept_guardianship` - Guardian accepts role
4. `remove_guardian` - Owner removes guardian

**Recovery Phase**:
5. `initiate_recovery` - Guardian starts recovery (creates time-lock)
6. `approve_recovery` - Guardian submits decrypted share
7. `complete_recovery` - Transfer ownership after M approvals
8. `cancel_recovery` - Owner cancels active recovery

**Security Features**:
- Mandatory time-lock delay (configurable, 1-30 days)
- Owner can cancel during delay
- On-chain event emission for notifications
- Subscription tier verification (Premium+)

#### Emergency Access Instructions (`instructions/emergency_access_management.rs`)

**Setup Phase**:
1. `initialize_emergency_access` - Create emergency config
2. `add_emergency_contact` - Add contact with access level
3. `accept_emergency_contact` - Contact accepts role
4. `remove_emergency_contact` - Owner removes contact

**Activity Tracking**:
5. `record_activity` - Auto-called on password operations
6. `manual_activity_ping` - Manual "I'm alive" button

**Emergency Activation**:
7. `check_and_start_countdown` - Cron job checks inactivity
8. `activate_emergency_access` - Grant access after grace period
9. `cancel_emergency_countdown` - Owner cancels countdown

**Key Features**:
- Automatic inactivity detection
- Two-stage countdown (inactivity → grace period)
- Configurable access levels
- Activity tracking on all password operations

### 3. Client-Side Cryptography

#### Shamir Secret Sharing (`lib/shamir-secret-sharing.ts`)

**Core Algorithm**:
- Polynomial-based secret sharing in GF(2^8)
- Information-theoretic security (M-1 shares reveal NOTHING)
- Lagrange interpolation for reconstruction

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
// Split secret into N shares with M threshold
splitSecret(secret: Uint8Array, threshold: number, totalShares: number): Share[]

// Reconstruct from M shares
reconstructSecret(shares: Share[]): Uint8Array

// Verify shares work correctly
verifyShares(secret: Uint8Array, shares: Share[], threshold: number): boolean

// Serialize for storage
serializeShare(share: Share): string
deserializeShare(encoded: string): Share
```

**Galois Field Arithmetic**:
- GF(2^8) field arithmetic (same as AES)
- Precomputed lookup tables for O(1) multiplication
- Irreducible polynomial: x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1 (0x11b)

**Performance**:
- Byte-wise processing for efficiency
- Constant-time operations
- Optimized table lookups

### 4. Error Handling

Added 22 new error codes to `errors.rs`:

**Social Recovery Errors**:
- `FeatureNotAvailable` - Subscription tier too low
- `InvalidThreshold` - Invalid M-of-N configuration
- `InvalidRecoveryDelay` - Delay outside 1-30 day range
- `TooManyGuardians` - More than 10 guardians
- `GuardianAlreadyExists` - Duplicate guardian
- `GuardianNotFound` - Guardian doesn't exist
- `NotActiveGuardian` - Guardian not active
- `RecoveryNotReady` - Time-lock not elapsed
- `InsufficientApprovals` - Not enough guardian approvals

**Emergency Access Errors**:
- `InvalidInactivityPeriod` - Outside 30 days - 1 year range
- `InvalidGracePeriod` - Less than 1 day
- `TooManyContacts` - More than 5 contacts
- `ContactAlreadyExists` - Duplicate contact
- `GracePeriodNotElapsed` - Countdown still active
- `NoActiveCountdown` - No countdown to cancel

## Security Model

### Social Recovery Security

1. **Shamir Secret Sharing**:
   - Master key split into N shares
   - Any M shares reconstruct key
   - M-1 shares reveal ZERO information
   - Information-theoretic security (no crypto assumptions)

2. **Time-Lock Protection**:
   - Mandatory delay (default 7 days)
   - Owner receives on-chain events
   - Can cancel during delay period
   - Prevents instant wallet takeover

3. **Encrypted Share Distribution**:
   - Each share encrypted with guardian's public key (X25519)
   - Ephemeral key exchange
   - Guardians never see plaintext shares
   - On-chain encrypted storage

4. **Audit Trail**:
   - All recovery attempts logged on-chain
   - Guardian additions/removals tracked
   - Immutable history
   - Event emission for off-chain indexing

### Emergency Access Security

1. **Inactivity Detection**:
   - Configurable period (30 days - 1 year)
   - Updated on every password operation
   - Manual ping option
   - Cron-compatible checking

2. **Two-Stage Countdown**:
   - Stage 1: Inactivity → countdown starts
   - Grace period (default 7 days)
   - Owner can cancel
   - Stage 2: Grace expires → access granted

3. **Access Levels**:
   - ViewOnly: Specific entries only
   - FullAccess: View and export all
   - TransferOwnership: Full control

4. **Automatic Revocation**:
   - Access revokes when owner returns
   - Activity tracking resumes
   - Countdown resets

## Why This Matters

### Problem Solved

**Web3's Biggest UX Problem**: Wallet loss = permanent data loss

- Traditional password managers: Can reset with email
- Web3 password managers (without recovery): Wallet lost = data gone forever
- Solana Lockbox (with recovery): Guardian network recovers access

### Competitive Advantage

**First-to-Market Features**:
1. Social recovery in a blockchain password manager
2. Time-locked emergency access (dead man's switch)
3. M-of-N threshold cryptography for recovery
4. Automated inactivity monitoring

**vs. Competitors**:
- **1Password/Bitwarden**: Centralized, can be hacked, requires email
- **MetaMask**: No password manager, wallet-only recovery
- **Other Web3**: No recovery mechanism at all
- **Solana Lockbox**: Decentralized + Social recovery + Emergency access

### Business Impact

- **User Retention**: Users won't lose data if wallet is lost
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Companies need recovery mechanisms
- **Premium Conversion**: Recovery is Premium+ feature
- **Market Differentiation**: Unique selling proposition
