## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Test the Implementation

```bash
# Start the development server
cd nextjs-app
npm run dev
```

**Test Checklist**:
- [ ] AppHeader displays correctly
- [ ] Storage indicator shows accurate percentage
- [ ] Storage bar color changes based on usage
- [ ] Clicking storage bar navigates to `/settings?tab=subscription`
- [ ] Settings page loads with all 6 tabs
- [ ] Account tab shows wallet info correctly
- [ ] Subscription tab displays all tier cards
- [ ] USD pricing displays on subscription cards
- [ ] "Most Popular" and "Best Value" badges show
- [ ] Security tab shows backup codes interface
- [ ] Import/Export tab functions correctly
- [ ] Preferences tab loads without errors
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation works
- [ ] Deep linking (`?tab=X`) works

### 2. Configure Your Treasury Wallet

**Option A: Quick Test (Devnet)**
```typescript
// nextjs-app/app/page.tsx
const TREASURY_WALLET = new PublicKey('YOUR_TEST_WALLET_ADDRESS');

<AuthProvider
  programId={PROGRAM_ID}
  treasuryWallet={TREASURY_WALLET}
>
```

**Option B: Production Setup**
```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_WALLET=YOUR_PRODUCTION_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

### 3. Rebuild the Rust Program (Optional)

If you want to deploy the updated program with flexible fee receivers:

```bash
# Build the program
anchor build

# Deploy to devnet (if needed)
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet

# Or just test locally
anchor test
```

**Note**: The program changes are **optional**. The SDK will work with the existing deployed program, but fees will still go to the program ID unless you redeploy.

### 4. Update Documentation

Add treasury wallet instructions to your README:

```markdown
## Configuring Fee Collection

Subscription fees can be sent to any wallet you control:

\`\`\`typescript
import { PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js';

const TREASURY_WALLET = new PublicKey('YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS');

<AuthProvider
  programId={PROGRAM_ID}
  treasuryWallet={TREASURY_WALLET}
>
\`\`\`

See [TREASURY_WALLET_QUICKSTART.md](./TREASURY_WALLET_QUICKSTART.md) for details.
```

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Free User Upgrades to Basic

1. **Setup**: Connect with a wallet that has a Free tier lockbox
2. **Action**: Navigate to `/settings?tab=subscription`
3. **Action**: Click "Upgrade Now" on Basic tier card
4. **Expected**:
   - Wallet prompts for 0.001 SOL payment
   - Treasury wallet receives 0.001 SOL
   - User's tier updates to Basic
   - Storage limit increases to 10KB

### Scenario 2: Storage Indicator Warning

1. **Setup**: Fill your vault to 85% capacity
2. **Expected**:
   - Header storage bar turns yellow
   - Percentage shows 85%
   - Hover tooltip suggests upgrading

3. **Action**: Fill vault to 95% capacity
4. **Expected**:
   - Storage bar turns red
   - Upgrade button may pulse (if implemented)

### Scenario 3: Deep Linking

1. **Action**: Navigate directly to `/settings?tab=security`
2. **Expected**: Settings page opens with Security tab active
3. **Action**: Change URL to `/settings?tab=subscription`
4. **Expected**: Tab switches to Subscription without page reload

### Scenario 4: Mobile Responsive

1. **Setup**: Resize browser to mobile width (< 768px)
2. **Expected**:
   - AppHeader remains sticky
   - Storage indicator spans full width
   - Tab navigation becomes icon-only
   - Subscription cards stack vertically

---

## üìä Performance Metrics

Expected performance:
- **Page Load**: < 2s (initial load with code splitting)
- **Tab Switch**: < 100ms (instant, no API calls)
- **Storage Indicator Update**: Real-time (from context)
- **Bundle Size**: +~50KB (new components)

Optimization opportunities:
- Lazy load settings page components
- Memoize subscription card rendering
- Virtual scrolling for large billing history (future)

---

## üêõ Known Issues to Address

### Minor Issues
1. **SettingsModal still exists** - Can be deprecated/removed in cleanup
2. **USD rate is hardcoded** - Should integrate with oracle (Pyth/Switchboard)
3. **Billing history is placeholder** - Need to fetch actual on-chain transactions
4. **No transaction receipts** - Should generate downloadable receipts

### Future Enhancements
1. **Auto-renew toggle** - Let users enable/disable automatic renewal
2. **Usage analytics charts** - Visual storage usage over time
3. **Email notifications** - Alert users of expiring subscriptions
4. **Promo codes** - Support for discount codes
5. **Gift subscriptions** - Allow users to gift premium tiers

## üîí Security Review Checklist

Before production deployment:

- [ ] Treasury wallet is a **hardware wallet** or **multisig**
- [ ] Treasury wallet private key is **NOT** in code/env files
- [ ] Production treasury wallet is **separate** from development
- [ ] Fee amounts are validated on-chain (in program)
- [ ] User cannot manipulate fee receiver (client-side only)
- [ ] Treasury wallet monitoring/alerts are configured
- [ ] Backup recovery process is documented
- [ ] Team members know how to access treasury wallet
- [ ] Audit log of all treasury wallet transactions exists

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Development
```typescript
// Use a dedicated devnet wallet for testing
const DEV_TREASURY = new PublicKey('DevTreasuryWalletAddress');
const PROD_TREASURY = new PublicKey('ProdTreasuryWalletAddress');

const TREASURY_WALLET = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? PROD_TREASURY
  : DEV_TREASURY;
```

### For Monitoring
```bash
# Watch treasury wallet in real-time
solana logs YOUR_TREASURY_WALLET --url devnet

# Check balance programmatically
solana balance YOUR_TREASURY_WALLET --url devnet
```

### For Revenue Tracking
```typescript
// Add to your analytics
useEffect(() => {
  if (subscriptionUpgraded) {
    analytics.track('Revenue', {
      source: 'subscription_upgrade',
      tier: newTier,
      amount: tierCost,
      wallet: treasuryWallet.toBase58(),
    });
  }
}, [subscriptionUpgraded]);
```
