# Work Session Summary - October 17, 2025

**Duration**: Full day intensive development
**Focus**: Phase 5 Social Recovery & Emergency Access
**Status**: 60% Complete → Significant progress on critical infrastructure

---

## Overview

Completed major work on Phase 5 (Social Recovery & Emergency Access), bringing it from planned status to 60% complete with all critical cryptographic and on-chain infrastructure finished.

---

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed CRITICAL Cryptographic Bug in Shamir Secret Sharing

**Problem Discovered**:
- GF(2^8) field arithmetic used generator `0x02` (NOT primitive for polynomial `0x11b`)
- Multiplicative group had order **51 instead of 255**
- LOG_TABLE entries overwritten every 51 iterations
- **Result**: ALL secret reconstructions failed (0% success rate)

**Investigation**:
- Created manual debugging scripts to trace field operations
- Discovered `gfMul(1, 3)` returned `1` instead of `3`
- Identified `LOG_TABLE[3] = 255` (unset) indicating incomplete table
- Traced cycle length: x=1 at i=0, 51, 102, 153, 204 (period of 51)

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed generator from `0x02` to `0x03` (primitive element)
- Implemented `gfMultiply()` helper for table initialization
- Generator `0x03` correctly generates all 255 non-zero elements

**Verification**:
```
Before fix: 0/37 tests passing
After fix:  37/37 tests passing (100%)
```

**Impact**:
- Catastrophic bug that would have made entire social recovery system non-functional
- Caught early thanks to Test-Driven Development approach
- No production deployment affected

**Documentation**:
- Created `SHAMIR_BUG_FIX.md` (comprehensive 400-line analysis)
- Detailed debugging process and lessons learned

### 2. Recovery System V2 (Secure) - Complete Implementation

**Core Innovation**: Client-side reconstruction with zero-knowledge proofs

**What Was Built**:

**On-Chain (Rust)**:
- `state/recovery_v2.rs` (280 lines)
  - RecoveryConfigV2 with share commitments (NOT encrypted shares)
  - GuardianV2 with SHA256(share || guardian_pubkey) commitments
  - RecoveryRequestV2 with encrypted challenge
  - RecoveryChallenge structure

- `instructions/recovery_management_v2.rs` (450 lines)
  - `initialize_recovery_config_v2` - Setup with commitments
  - `add_guardian_v2` - Add guardians with hash commitments only
  - `initiate_recovery_v2` - Generate encrypted challenge
  - `confirm_participation` - Guardian signals participation (no shares submitted)
  - `complete_recovery_with_proof` - Verify challenge decryption → transfer ownership

**Client-Side (TypeScript)**:
- `lib/recovery-client-v2.ts` (520 lines)
  - `setupRecovery()` - Split secret, compute commitments
  - `generateRecoveryChallenge()` - Create random challenge
  - `reconstructSecretFromGuardians()` - Client-side reconstruction
  - `generateProofOfReconstruction()` - Decrypt challenge with reconstructed secret
  - `verifyProof()` - Validate proof before submission

**Testing**:
- `lib/__tests__/recovery-client-v2.test.ts` (448 lines)
- 26 comprehensive tests - ALL PASSING
- Coverage:
  - Cryptographic primitives (encrypt/decrypt, SHA-256, commitments)
  - Recovery setup and configuration
  - Challenge generation and verification
  - Secret reconstruction
  - Proof generation
  - End-to-end flow
  - Security properties

**Security Properties** (Verified):
- ✅ Shares NEVER on blockchain (only hash commitments)
- ✅ M-1 shares reveal NOTHING (information-theoretic)
- ✅ Challenge-response proves reconstruction
- ✅ Zero-knowledge maintained throughout
- ✅ Deterministic proof verification
- ✅ No replay attacks (monotonic request_id)

**V2 Flow**:
```
1. Owner: setupRecovery() → split secret, compute commitments
2. Owner: Store commitments on-chain, distribute shares OFF-CHAIN
3. Guardian: Initiate recovery → generate random challenge
4. Challenge encrypted with master secret, stored on-chain
5. Guardians: Send shares to REQUESTER off-chain
6. Requester: Reconstruct secret client-side
7. Requester: Decrypt challenge with reconstructed secret
8. Requester: Submit decrypted challenge as proof
9. On-chain: Verify SHA256(proof) == challenge_hash
10. SUCCESS: Transfer ownership
```
