# Phase 5 UI Components - Progress Update

**Date**: October 17, 2025 (Continued Session)
**Phase 5 Status**: 70% Complete (up from 60%)
**Focus**: Recovery UI Components

---

## Overview

Continued Phase 5 development by creating production-ready UI components for the social recovery system. Built two comprehensive modals that provide a complete user interface for setting up and managing social recovery.

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Recovery Setup Modal (Multi-Step Wizard)

**Purpose**: Guide users through setting up social recovery with an intuitive 5-step wizard.

**Implementation**: `components/modals/RecoverySetupModal.tsx` (650+ lines)

**Features**:

#### Step 1: Guardian Selection
- Add 2-10 guardians with custom nicknames
- Real-time Solana address validation
- Guardian add/remove functionality
- Input validation (nickname + address required)
- Helpful tips for choosing guardians
- Visual feedback for valid/invalid guardians

#### Step 2: Threshold Configuration
- Visual slider for M-of-N threshold selection
- Dynamic range (2 to total guardians)
- Security recommendations based on selection
- Color-coded warnings:
  - Yellow: Lower threshold (easier recovery, less secure)
  - Green: Higher threshold (harder recovery, more secure)
  - Cyan: Recommended balance (majority + 1)

#### Step 3: Recovery Delay
- Time-lock configuration (1-30 days)
- Visual slider with day counter
- Default: 7 days (recommended)
- Warning for short delays (< 3 days)
- Explanation of time-lock purpose

#### Step 4: Share Distribution
- Automatic share generation using `setupRecovery()`
- Download shares for each guardian (JSON format)
- One-click download per guardian
- Security warnings:
  - Send only to designated guardian
  - Use secure channels (encrypted email, Signal, in person)
  - Never share multiple shares with one person
- V2 security callout (shares never on blockchain)

#### Step 5: Confirmation
- Review all configuration before submission
- Summary statistics:
  - Total guardians
  - Threshold (M of N)
  - Recovery delay (days)
  - Security level (V2 Secure)
- Complete guardian list with addresses
- Submit to blockchain button
- Green confirmation message

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
// Integration with recovery-client-v2
const setup = await setupRecovery(masterSecret, guardianInfos, threshold);

// Generates:
// - Guardian commitments (SHA256 hashes)
// - Encrypted shares for distribution
// - Master secret hash for on-chain storage
```

**User Experience**:
- Progress indicator showing current step
- Step validation (can't proceed without required data)
- Back/Next navigation
- Loading states for async operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Consistent with existing app styling (cyan/gray theme)

**State Management**:
- Form validation per step
- Guardian list management (add/remove/update)
- Threshold validation (within valid range)
- Share generation state
- Error state
- Loading state

---

### 2. Guardian Management Modal

**Purpose**: View and manage existing guardians after initial setup.

**Implementation**: `components/modals/GuardianManagementModal.tsx` (350+ lines)

**Features**:

#### Recovery Configuration Dashboard
- **Summary Stats**:
  - Threshold (M of N visualization)
  - Recovery delay (formatted days)
  - Active guardian count
- Grid layout for quick overview
- Real-time status updates

#### Guardian List
- Comprehensive guardian information:
  - Nickname (user-friendly identifier)
  - Solana address (truncated with ellipsis)
  - Share index (1-N)
  - Status (Active, Pending, Inactive)
  - Added date (formatted)
- Status badges with color coding:
  - Green: Active (ready for recovery)
  - Yellow: Pending (awaiting acceptance)
  - Gray: Inactive (removed or revoked)
- Hover effects for better UX

#### Guardian Actions
- **Add Guardian**: Button to add new guardians
- **Resend Share**: Regenerate and send share to guardian
- **Remove Guardian**: Remove guardian with confirmation dialog
  - Warning if removal drops below threshold
  - Two-step confirmation (prevent accidents)
  - Updates on-chain state

#### Security Information Panel
- Clear explanation of recovery process
- Threshold requirement
- Time-lock delay purpose
- V2 security callout

**User Experience**:
- Clean, scannable interface
- Color-coded status indicators
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Helpful security tips
- Responsive grid layouts
- Consistent styling

**Mock Data**:
Currently uses mock data for demonstration:
```typescript
const mockRecoveryConfig: RecoveryConfig = {
  threshold: 3,
  totalGuardians: 5,
  recoveryDelay: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 7 days
  guardians: [
    { nickname: 'Mom', status: 'active', ... },
    { nickname: 'Best Friend', status: 'active', ... },
    // ...
  ],
};
```

**TODO**: Replace with actual on-chain data fetching

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- React (hooks: useState, useEffect)
- @solana/wallet-adapter-react (useWallet)
- @solana/web3.js (PublicKey)
- recovery-client-v2 (setupRecovery, GuardianInfo, RecoverySetup)
- shamir-secret-sharing (splitSecret, Share)

### Type Safety
Full TypeScript implementation with interfaces:
```typescript
interface RecoverySetupModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  masterSecret: Uint8Array;
}

interface GuardianInput {
  id: string;
  address: string;
  nickname: string;
  isValid: boolean;
}

type SetupStep = 'guardians' | 'threshold' | 'delay' | 'shares' | 'confirmation';
```

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Dark theme (gray-900 base, cyan accents)
- Consistent with existing modals
- Custom animations and transitions

### Integration Points
```typescript
// Modal exports
export { default as RecoverySetupModal } from './RecoverySetupModal';
export { default as GuardianManagementModal } from './GuardianManagementModal';

// Usage in app
import { RecoverySetupModal, GuardianManagementModal } from '@/components/modals';
```

## User Flow Example

### Setting Up Recovery

1. **User** clicks "Set Up Recovery" in app
2. **RecoverySetupModal** opens
3. **Step 1**: User adds 5 guardians (Mom, Best Friend, Brother, Spouse, Colleague)
4. **Step 2**: User sets threshold to 3-of-5
5. **Step 3**: User sets 7-day recovery delay
6. **Step 4**: User downloads 5 shares, sends to each guardian via Signal
7. **Step 5**: User reviews config and clicks "Complete Setup"
8. **On-chain**: Transaction submitted to blockchain
9. **Confirmation**: Success message, recovery is active

### Managing Guardians

1. **User** clicks "Manage Guardians" in settings
2. **GuardianManagementModal** opens
3. **Dashboard** shows 3-of-5 threshold, 7-day delay, 5 active guardians
4. **User** sees Brother's status is "Pending" (hasn't accepted yet)
5. **User** clicks "Resend Share" to send Brother a new copy
6. **User** decides to add a 6th guardian (Trusted Colleague)
7. **User** clicks "Add Guardian", modal appears (TODO)
8. **User** closes modal, guardians are updated

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security
- Master secret never leaves user's browser
- Shares generated locally using Web Crypto API
- Share commitments (not shares) stored on-chain
- V2 ensures shares are never exposed on blockchain

### User Education
- Clear warnings about secure share distribution
- Tips for choosing trustworthy guardians
- Explanation of threshold security tradeoffs
- Time-lock delay purpose and recommendations

### Data Validation
- Solana address format validation
- Threshold range validation (2 to N)
- Minimum guardian count (2)
- Maximum guardian count (10)
- Share index uniqueness (1 to N, no duplicates)
