- Clear instructions on card
- Physical backup option
- Professional presentation

### Security Benefits:
- Checksum validation prevents corruption
- Version control for compatibility
- Clear warnings on card
- Physical security (lockbox, safe)
- No digital traces (offline backup)

### Distribution Flexibility:

2. **Print**: Give physical card in person
3. **QR**: Scan code in person (no digital trail)
4. **Hybrid**: Email encrypted QR code image

3. Add encryption for email distribution
4. Polish UI transitions and animations

### Medium-term (1-2 weeks):

## Technical Highlights

### Shamir Secret Sharing Validation
The integration tests validate the CRITICAL cryptographic fix from this morning:
- Generator 0x03 (not 0x02)
- GF(2^8) field arithmetic
- Lagrange interpolation
- Threshold reconstruction

**Test Result**: ‚úÖ Secret reconstructs correctly from any M shares

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Flow
The integration tests demonstrate the V2 secure flow:
1. Secret split ‚Üí hash commitments on-chain
2. Recovery initiated ‚Üí encrypted challenge generated
3. Shares collected off-chain ‚Üí secret reconstructed client-side
4. Challenge decrypted ‚Üí proof submitted
5. On-chain verification ‚Üí ownership transferred

**Security**: ‚úÖ Shares never exposed on blockchain

### QR Code Design
The QR code format is designed for:
- **Forward compatibility**: Version field for upgrades
- **Data integrity**: SHA-256 checksum
- **Mobile scanning**: Base64 encoding
- **Human readable**: Professional card design
- **Error resilience**: Checksum validation

Building the integration test suite early would have:
- Caught the GF(2^8) bug faster
- Validated the V2 design sooner
- Enabled faster iteration

**Takeaway**: Always build tests alongside features

### 2. User Experience Matters
The QR code + printable cards significantly improve guardian experience:
- More likely to keep shares safe
- Easier to understand what to do
- Professional presentation builds trust

**Takeaway**: Think about end-user workflow, not just technical implementation

### 3. Multiple Distribution Options > Single
Offering JSON + Card + Print gives flexibility:
- Tech-savvy guardians: JSON file
- Non-technical guardians: Printed card
- In-person setup: QR scan

**Takeaway**: Support diverse user preferences

### 4. Documentation is Valuable
The comprehensive documentation created today:
- Helps onboard new contributors
- Serves as living specification
- Enables easier debugging
- Provides project continuity

**Takeaway**: Document as you build, not after
