# Solana Lockbox - Hackathon Submission

**Solana Colosseum Hackathon Entry**

## Executive Summary

**Solana Lockbox** is a decentralized password manager that stores encrypted credentials on the Solana blockchain. Unlike traditional password managers that rely on centralized servers, Solana Lockbox gives users **true ownership** of their data with wallet-based encryption and blockchain permanence.

### Key Innovation

We've built the **first blockchain-native password manager** that turns Web3's biggest weakness (password management) into a strength (verifiable, decentralized storage). Users encrypt passwords client-side with their Solana wallet, store ciphertext on-chain, and maintain complete control without trusting any company.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Password Management is Broken

**Traditional Password Managers** (LastPass, 1Password, Dashlane):
- ❌ **Single Point of Failure**: Company servers get hacked → all passwords leak
- ❌ **Trust Required**: You must trust the company to:
  - Not read your passwords
  - Keep servers secure
  - Not shut down service
  - Not sell your data
- ❌ **Account Lockouts**: Forget master password → lose everything
- ❌ **Platform Lock-In**: Hard to export/migrate data

**Recent Breaches Prove the Risk:**
- LastPass (2022): 30 million users affected, encrypted vaults stolen
- Passwordstate (2021): Supply chain attack, plaintext passwords stolen
- OneLogin (2017): Database breach, AWS keys compromised

**Browser Password Managers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari):
- ❌ Sync requires Google/Mozilla/Apple account (centralized)
- ❌ No cross-browser compatibility
- ❌ Weak encryption (often tied to OS password)
- ❌ No audit trail

### Web3 Users Face Unique Challenges

1. **Too Many Passwords**: DeFi accounts, NFT marketplaces, DAOs, dApp logins
2. **High Stakes**: Passwords often protect accounts with real financial value
3. **No Web3-Native Solution**: Existing managers don't integrate with Solana wallets
4. **Recovery Problem**: Lose seed phrase → lose everything (no company to call)

## Our Solution: Blockchain-Native Password Management

### How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐
│   User      │
│  (Wallet)   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       │ 1. Derive encryption key from wallet + master password
       │    (PBKDF2: 100k iterations)
       ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Client-Side Encryption     │
│  (AES-256-GCM)             │
│                             │
│  Plaintext → Ciphertext    │
└──────────┬──────────────────┘
           │
           │ 2. Store encrypted data on-chain
           │    (Solana program: PDA-based access control)
           ▼
    ┌──────────────┐
    │  Solana      │
    │  Blockchain  │
    │              │
    │  [Ciphertext]│  ← Immutable, replicated, globally available
    └──────────────┘
```

### Architecture

**Client-Side (Next.js PWA):**
- Wallet connection via @solana/wallet-adapter
- PBKDF2 key derivation (wallet keypair + master password)
- AES-256-GCM encryption (unique nonce per entry)
- Progressive Web App (installable, offline-capable)
- Mobile Wallet Adapter for Solana Seeker integration

**On-Chain (Anchor Program):**
- PDA-based access control (each wallet owns unique vault)
- Storage chunks (up to 100 chunks × 10 KB = 1 MB max)
- Dynamic expansion (pay only for what you use)
- Rate limiting (prevent DoS attacks)
- Recovery mechanism (backup codes with rate limiting)

**Key Innovation:**
- **No Backend Server**: Frontend talks directly to Solana RPC
- **Wallet-Based Auth**: Your wallet IS your identity
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Blockchain only sees ciphertext
- **Open Source**: Auditable, self-hostable, transparent

---

## Why This Belongs in "Consumer Apps"

### 1. Real Consumer Problem
