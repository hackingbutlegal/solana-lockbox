## Executive Summary

**Solana Lockbox** is a decentralized password manager that stores encrypted credentials on the Solana blockchain. Unlike traditional password managers that rely on centralized servers, Solana Lockbox gives users **true ownership** of their data with wallet-based encryption and blockchain permanence.

### Key Innovation: You Can't Lose Your Passwords (And You Don't Pay Forever)

**Two hidden problems with password managers:**

**Problem 1: Device Loss**
- **Cloud managers** (LastPass, 1Password): Pay forever or lose access
- **Local managers** (KeePass): Lose your .kdbx file → lose everything

**Problem 2: Subscription Trap**
- LastPass: **$36/year** = **$360 over 10 years**
- 1Password: **$35.88/year** = **$358.80 over 10 years**
- Dashlane: **$59.88/year** = **$598.80 over 10 years**

**Solana Lockbox solves BOTH:**

### 🔑 Permanent Recoverability
✅ **Drop your phone in a lake?** Buy new phone → connect wallet → all passwords back
✅ **Computer dies?** Install app → connect wallet → vault restored
✅ **Forgot to backup?** Don't need to. It's on-chain forever.
✅ **Multi-device sync?** Automatic. No iCloud/Dropbox/Google Drive needed.

### 💰 Pay Once, Own Forever
✅ **Start small: ~$10** (0.071 SOL for 10KB ≈ 50 passwords)
✅ **Expand as needed:** Pay only for storage you use
✅ **10-year cost: Still just storage** (no subscriptions)
✅ **Recoverable:** Close your account → get your rent back

**Storage Expansion Costs** (linear scaling):
- 10 KB (Free tier): ~$10 one-time → ~50 passwords
- 100 KB (Basic): ~$100 one-time → ~250 passwords
- 1 MB (Premium): ~$1,020 one-time → ~2,500 passwords

**How It Works:**
1. Start with 10KB (enough for most users)
2. Need more? Expand by exact bytes needed
3. Pay proportional rent (e.g., +10KB = +$10)
4. Close account anytime → recover ALL rent paid

**Cost Comparison:**
- **Small user** (~50 passwords): $10 once vs $360 over 10 years (LastPass) = **97% savings**
- **Power user** (~250 passwords): $100 once vs $360 over 10 years (LastPass) = **72% savings**
- **Enterprise user** (1,000+ passwords): May cost more than subscriptions, but YOU own the data (no ongoing fees, no company dependency)

**This is the first password manager where losing your device doesn't mean losing your passwords AND you don't pay rent forever.**

## Problem Statement

### Current Password Management is Broken

**Traditional Password Managers** (LastPass, 1Password, Dashlane):
- ❌ **Single Point of Failure**: Company servers get hacked → all passwords leak
- ❌ **Trust Required**: You must trust the company to:
  - Not read your passwords
  - Keep servers secure
  - Not shut down service
  - Not sell your data
- ❌ **Account Lockouts**: Forget master password → lose everything
- ❌ **Platform Lock-In**: Hard to export/migrate data

**Recent Breaches Prove the Risk:**
- LastPass (2022): 30 million users affected, encrypted vaults stolen
- Passwordstate (2021): Supply chain attack, plaintext passwords stolen
- OneLogin (2017): Database breach, AWS keys compromised

**Browser Password Managers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari):
- ❌ Sync requires Google/Mozilla/Apple account (centralized)
- ❌ No cross-browser compatibility
- ❌ Weak encryption (often tied to OS password)
- ❌ No audit trail

**Local Password Managers** (KeePass, local 1Password vaults, Bitwarden self-hosted):
- ✅ **No centralization risk** (you control the file)
- ✅ **No company to trust** (fully local)
- ❌ **File loss = data loss**: Lose the .kdbx file → lose everything
- ❌ **Manual backup required**: Must remember to backup to Dropbox/USB/etc.
- ❌ **Sync complexity**: Need to manually sync across devices via cloud storage
- ❌ **Device loss scenario**: Laptop stolen → if file wasn't backed up recently, lost passwords

**The Recovery Problem**: All existing solutions fail when you lose your device AND forgot to backup recently.

### Web3 Users Face Unique Challenges

1. **Too Many Passwords**: DeFi accounts, NFT marketplaces, DAOs, dApp logins
2. **High Stakes**: Passwords often protect accounts with real financial value
3. **No Web3-Native Solution**: Existing managers don't integrate with Solana wallets
4. **Recovery Problem**: Lose seed phrase → lose everything (no company to call)

```

### Architecture

**Client-Side (Next.js PWA):**
- Wallet connection via @solana/wallet-adapter
- PBKDF2 key derivation (wallet keypair + master password)
- AES-256-GCM encryption (unique nonce per entry)
- Progressive Web App (installable, offline-capable)
- Mobile Wallet Adapter for Solana Seeker integration

**On-Chain (Anchor Program):**
- PDA-based access control (each wallet owns unique vault)
- Storage chunks (up to 100 chunks × 10 KB = 1 MB max)
- Dynamic expansion (pay only for what you use)
- Rate limiting (prevent DoS attacks)
- Recovery mechanism (backup codes with rate limiting)

**Key Innovation:**
- **No Backend Server**: Frontend talks directly to Solana RPC
- **Wallet-Based Auth**: Your wallet IS your identity
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Blockchain only sees ciphertext
- **Open Source**: Auditable, self-hostable, transparent
