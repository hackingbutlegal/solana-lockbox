## CRITICAL FINDING: Encryption Algorithm Discrepancy

### Issue: XChaCha20-Poly1305 vs AES-256-GCM

**Status**: CRITICAL MISMATCH FOUND

The FAQ and user-facing components claim **XChaCha20-Poly1305** encryption, while the README and actual implementation use **AES-256-GCM** via Web Crypto API.

#### Where the Discrepancy Appears:

**FAQ Component** (`components/layout/FAQ.tsx`, line 42):
```
"All encryption happens in your browser using XChaCha20-Poly1305 (military-grade encryption)."
```

**Password Manager Component** (`components/features/PasswordManager.tsx`):
```
<p>XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption • Your data stays private, always</p>
```

**Actual Implementation** (`lib/crypto.ts`, line 162-163):
```typescript
// Uses nacl.secretbox which implements XChaCha20-Poly1305
const ciphertext = nacl.secretbox(plaintext, nonce, sessionKey);
```

**README.md** (lines 39, 57):
```
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM via Web Crypto API
- ✅ Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption
```

#### Analysis:
The actual implementation file shows XChaCha20-Poly1305 IS being used via `nacl.secretbox()`. The README appears to be outdated. The user-facing claims in FAQ and PasswordManager components are CORRECT - they match the actual code.

**VERDICT**: Update README.md to reflect XChaCha20-Poly1305 instead of AES-256-GCM.

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Update README.md**
   - Change "AES-256-GCM" to "XChaCha20-Poly1305"
   - Lines 39, 57, and any other references

2. **Verify "First-of-its-kind" Claim**
   - Research competitive landscape
   - Consider documenting sources or softening language

3. **Batch Mode UI**
   - Components are removed from code but still referenced in some places
   - Ensure UI completely removes any batch mode references or re-enable feature

### Medium Priority

4. **Devnet Warning Prominence**
   - Consider a prominent banner on home page in addition to FAQ
   - Currently only visible in FAQ section

5. **Session Timeout Documentation**
   - Settings show "15 minutes" is default and configurable
   - Verify this setting actually updates behavior

6. **Password Health Scoring**
   - Dashboard shows A-F grades
   - Ensure algorithm is well-documented elsewhere in codebase

### Low Priority

7. **Marketing Language Review**
   - "Military-grade encryption" is acceptable but marketing-heavy
   - Consider "Industry-standard" as alternative

8. **Link Validation**
   - FAQ links to Solana Explorer and faucet
   - Periodically verify these remain valid and unchanged

## Complete FAQ Text Archive

### Security & Encryption FAQs

**Q: How does encryption work?**
> All encryption happens in your browser using XChaCha20-Poly1305 (military-grade encryption). Your wallet signature is used to derive a session key, which encrypts your data. The encrypted data is then stored on Solana's blockchain.

**Q: Where are my encryption keys stored?**
> Your encryption keys are NEVER stored anywhere. They exist only in your browser's memory during your session and are derived from your wallet signature each time. When you close or refresh the page, keys are wiped from memory.

**Q: Is my data visible on the blockchain?**
> Yes, the encrypted data is publicly visible on Solana's blockchain - but it's completely encrypted. Without your wallet, the data appears as random bytes. No one can decrypt it except you.

**Q: Why does decrypted data auto-hide?**
> For security! After you decrypt and view data, it automatically hides after 30 seconds and is cleared from memory. This prevents shoulder surfing and accidental exposure if you leave your screen unlocked.

**Q: What's the session timeout?**
> Your session automatically expires after 15 minutes of inactivity. This protects you if you forget to disconnect your wallet. You'll need to reconnect to continue.

**Q: Is this safe to use? Can I store my real passwords?**
> ⚠️ WARNING: Lockbox is currently in TESTING PHASE and has NOT been professionally audited. The program may contain bugs or security vulnerabilities. DO NOT store sensitive, real-world passwords or private keys during testing. Use only test data. This is deployed on Devnet (test network) which can be reset at any time. Wait for the mainnet-audited version before storing real sensitive data.

**Q: Can someone access my data if they hack Solana?**
> No. Even if someone had full access to Solana's blockchain data, your encrypted data would appear as random bytes. The encryption happens client-side with keys derived from YOUR wallet signature.
